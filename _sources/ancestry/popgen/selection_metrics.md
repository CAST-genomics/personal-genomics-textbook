# 3.8 Detecting signals of positive selection

In section 3.4 we introduced the concept of *selection*. In addition to the types of selection described there (directional, balancing, disruptive), we can also think about selection in terms of the direction of the fitness impact an allele has. If an allele is under *negative selection*, meaning it has negative fitness consequences, it will tend to be eliminated from the population. Examples of alleles under strong negative selection would be those that are embryonic lethal (meaning a person cannot survive with that genetic variant) or those that result in a condition in which a person will tend to have few or no offspring (e.g. infertility, or severe psychiatric disorder).

On the other hand, if an allele is under *positive selection*, it means that an allele confers a fitness advantage and will tend to spread in the population. Often, positive selection may be related to local environmental adaptations, such as resistance to a disease or adaptation to a particular climate. 

There are multiple metrics that can be used to identify regions of the genome that may be under positive selection. Several of these are used or introduced in Sabeti et al. 2007 {cite}`Sabeti2007`. These metrics, and terminology related to them, are introduced below.

## Haplotype tests

If an allele rises to high frequency in the population quickly due to positive selection, it will often exhibit long-range linkage disequilibrium (LD) with other variants if there has not been enough time since the selection event for recombination to break down the LD. As a result, alleles found on unusually *long-range haplotypes* may represent variants under positive selection. There are multiple metrics to detect this:
