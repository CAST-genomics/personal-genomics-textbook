# Chapter 3: Introduction to population genetics

In order to interpret one individual's genome, we will need to consider it in the context of patterns of genetic variation observed across en entire population of people, and the forces driving these patterns. 

Note, population genetics itself is a whole field. We just touch on basics here that we will need for future applications in personal genomics. For more detailed reading on this topic, we recommend Hartl and Clark's textbook "Principles of Population Genetics".
