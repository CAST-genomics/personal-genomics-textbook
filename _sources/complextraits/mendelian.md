# Chapter 6: Mendelian(ish) traits

Whereas the previous modules focused on learning about ancestry from our genomes, future modules will explore the relationship between our genomes and different *traits* or *phenotypes*. Some of these will be mostly for fun (e.g. eye color or hair thickness) but others will be medically relevant (e.g. predicting the risk of heart disease). However, in almost all of what we do in future modules, we'll need to continue to take ancestry into account.

We will generally be breaking traits into two categories (but as we'll discuss, there is certainly overlap between these).

* *Mendelian traits* will tend to be controlled by genetic variation within a single gene.
* *Complex traits* are controlled by genetic variation across multiple genes or genomic regions. For some traits (e.g. height) literally thousands of genes may be involved.

In reality, these categories are clear cut, and we could instead place traits along a "spectrum" from least polygenic (e.g. strictly Mendelian traits) to most polygenic (e.g. height).

Generally, we'll see that variants resulting in Mendelian disorders tend to have really high impacts on fitness, and thus are kept relatively rare in the population due to selection. An exception to this would be variants that have a severe impact, but the impact is only manifested later in life after childbearing years (e.g. Alzheimer's Disease). On the other hand, the individual variants contributing to complex traits might actually be quite common, since each will have a small impact on disease risk and therefore are under more modest selection.

In this chapter, we will cover some basics of Mendelian traits. For most of the remaining chapters, we will shift our focus to complex traits.
