# Personal Genomics for Bioinformaticians

These online lecture notes are meant to accompany the UCSD graduate level course CSE284 as well as to explore topics studied by the [Center for Admixture Science and Technology](https://admixgenomics.ucsd.edu/).

Most chapters contain a mix of text on core topics in medical and population genetics, tutorials on topics such as file formats and software packages that are likely to change over time, and links to hands on activities in the form of either interactive Jupyter notebooks or discussion questions.
