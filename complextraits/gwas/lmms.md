# 7.5 Linear mixed models

In previous sections, we introduced the concept of association testing for GWAS using linear or logistic models. We also saw how factors, most commonly ancestry, can confound association tests, and added population PCs as covariates to our models to control for this confounding and reduce in inflation in the p-values.

Here, we'll introduce an extension of the linear models considered previously, known as *linear mixed models* that will help us further control for possible confounding from relatedness and also as a result will help improve power to detect associations. The concept of statistical power will be described in more detail in a subsequent section.

In future chapters, we'll use LMMs for a number of applications including:

* Estimating heritability
* Partitioning trait variance explained between different genomic annotations
