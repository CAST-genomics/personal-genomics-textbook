# 2.5 Reference Genome

A human reference genome is assembled from sequencing DNAÂ from a number of individual donors, and used as a standard to compare DNA sequence. 
It took 15 years of international effort to complete the first draft of Human Genome Project (HGP) in 2003 using Sanger sequencing. Since then, Genome Reference Consortium (GRC) 
has curated and released many versions, most commonly used now are hg19 and hg38.

Pangenome was released in recently to capture more variance and complexity.
