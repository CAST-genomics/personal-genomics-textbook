# Personal Genomics for Bioinformaticians

This online textbook is meant to accompany the UCSD graduate level course CSE284.

Most chapters contain a mix of text on topics in medical and population genetics, tutorials on topics such as file formats and software packages that are likely to change over time, and links to hands on activities in the form of either interactive Jupyter notebooks or discussion questions.
